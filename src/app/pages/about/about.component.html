        Software engineer based in Minnesota who's been building web applications for the past nine years. 
        What started as curiosity about how software works has turned into a career centered around solving problems with code.

        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
          I graduated from Metropolitan State University with a Computer Science degree and jumped straight into building 
          applications with .NET and SQL Server. Over the years, I've worked at everything from small companies where 
          I wore multiple hats to larger organizations with established processes and enterprise-scale challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          My experience has taken me through different industries - from insurance and manufacturing to payroll and marketing. 
          Each environment taught me something different about how software fits into business operations.

        <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
        <p>
          I genuinely enjoy the problem-solving aspect of development. Every project brings unique constraints and requirements, 
          and finding elegant solutions within those boundaries keeps the work interesting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond the technical challenges, I find great value in mentoring other developers. There's something rewarding about 
          helping someone work through a difficult concept or watching them grow in their skills.

        <h2>Current Focus</h2>
        <p>
          These days, I spend most of my time building full-stack applications with .NET and Angular. I've worked on 
          interesting challenges like automating e-filing systems, building SSO solutions, and migrating legacy applications 
          to modern frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm particularly drawn to system architecture and how applications scale - designing solutions that handle growth 
          gracefully, whether that's more users, data, or complex business requirements.

          <h2>Why CodeDaily</h2>
          <p>
            I started this blog to share practical lessons from real projects including actual trade-offs and decisions that come up when building software in business environments, along with the latest new and updates in software developement.

            My goal is to write about things that would have been useful for me to know earlier in my career, 
            focusing on development, system design, and the intersection of technology and business needs.

      <h2>Beyond the Code</h2>
      <p>
        When I'm not developing software, I enjoy reading, hiking Minnesota's trails, and spending time with family. 
        I believe in maintaining perspective - software development is intellectually rewarding work, but it's still just work. 
        The best solutions often come when you step away from the screen and let your mind process problems in the background.
